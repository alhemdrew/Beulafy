## 🏪 How the Store Works
Beulafy stores are designed for seamless interaction and commerce:
1. **Store Creation:** Users answer simple questions, and Beulafy generates a functional store automatically.  
2. **Browsing Products:** Visitors can navigate the store, view product/article cards, and explore available items.  
3. **Purchase Options:** Users can either:
   - Purchase directly within the store (if enabled)  
   - Or go to a **WhatsApp page** for direct communication with the seller.  
4. **WhatsApp Integration:** Every store generates a WhatsApp link so buyers can chat, ask questions, or confirm purchases.  
5. **Contact If Code Not Available:**
